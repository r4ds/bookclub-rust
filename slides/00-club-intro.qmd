## Book club meetings

-   Volunteer leads discussion of a chapter
    -   **This is the best way to learn the material.**
-   Presentations: 
    -   Review of material
    -   Questions you have
    -   Maybe live demo
-   More info about editing: [this github repo](https://github.com/r4ds/bookclub-rust).
-   Recorded, available on the [Data Science Learning Community YouTube Channel (DSLC.video)](http://dslc.video).

## Pace

-   **Goal:** 1 chapter/week
-   Ok to split overwhelming chapters
-   Ok to combine short chapters
-   Meet ***every*** week except holidays, etc
    -   Ideally can discuss even if presenter unavailable

## Learning objectives (LOs)

-   Students who study with LOs in mind ***retain more.***
-   **Tips:**
    -   "After today's session, you will be able to..."
    -   *Very* roughly **1 per section.**
