This is a companion for the book [_The Rust Programming Language_](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/title-page.html) by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols, with contributions from the Rust Community (copyright 2024).

Each chapter title to the left is a link to a slide deck.

-   These slides are being developed *by this club.*
-   Each deck will open in its own tab.
-   You may want to type "s" at the start of each deck to open the *s*peaker notes.
-   [Join the Data Science Learning Community](https://dslc.io/join) to participate in the discussion!
